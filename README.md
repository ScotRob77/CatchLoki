# Catch Loki
Catch Loki is a quick fire game which has 3 user levels and is based on the Norse mythology of Thor, Loki and Asgard which has been recently played out on the big screen in Marvels Thor and Avenger movies. When the user opens the initial page they are greeted with the title, the rules, 3 game levels and 6 Thor characters. The user chooses which level they want to play. When the game starts the Thor images disappear. When they reappear one of them is Loki. The user has to click on Loki before all the images disappear again.

### Future features
* Add more hero characters
* Incorporate sound to the game

# Typography and color scheme
* I want a font that makes the game feel a bit futuristic and 'Tapestry' works very well [Google Fonts](https://www.Fonts.google.com)
* I want a relevant background to the game so will use a cartoon interpretation of Asgard and the bi-frost which is used to travel through space from Asgard.
